Predicting SST using machine learning
Project idea: SST spatial distribution prediction using machine learning
Pitch + Ideation: Predict SST anomalies (upwelling, etc), generate SST spatial distribution, the model can also be used with other type of data as input!  
STEPS:
Data, boundary box (time [2000-2020], lat [-5,32], lon[45,90])
Split
Model Architecture: 
ConvLSTM
3D CNN
Transformers
Hybrid: CNN + Transformer + LSTM
* SHAPE CORRECT
Complie and fit
Early-stop
* Loss function: MSE, MAE, SSIM
* metric
Visualization of result and Interpretation!
