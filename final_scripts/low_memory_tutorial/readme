In this repository we provide useful functions and a script which allows you to run a ConvLSTM deep learning model in a low memory machine. 
This script can be adapted to train a bigger dataset ( and obtain much better results). It also can be used with higher memory machines. 
We trained the model dividing the bounding box (area of interest) in smaller pieces in order to be able to run the script in low memory computers.
